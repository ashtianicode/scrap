# scrap
back up of ubuntu /documents/scrap


these are a few of my python scraping codes.
mostly old codes and are messy,long, not object oriented.
but any way i thought i upload them and share.

maybe in future i clean the code and make it a little better

have scraped 9 websites till now , have learned and invented many efficient ways and worked with many tools for that aim
it has been my best hobby
